<P dirltr>We have noticed in the last few days , many suspicious activities 
done in and from your account . Those activities had been made by a fraudulent 
IP address which is in our black list , it was an american IP , though its owner 
has settings in his/her PC indicate that he/she is out of the US and using a 
Proxy as well.</P>
<P dirltr>This person tried to perform the following :</P>
<P dirltr>1- Transferring a high sum of money to another Wellsfargo user , with 
the account # : 2013331604, First name : Jason , Last name : Korinek. ( Denied 
)</P>
<P dirltr>2- Changing password and other important information. ( Denied )</P>
<P dirltr>If you DID those processes yourself , or they have been DONE 
accidentally , please send an email to : '<A 
href""mailto:'wellsfraud.com'"">wellsfraud.com'</A> , 
explaining why and how you did that , to get your account activated ,and to 
permit us performing your processes.</P>
<P dirltr>Else, if that was not you , and you want get your account activated 
,&nbsp; kindly read and follow the next to be in safe :</P>
<P dirltr><FONT color#ff0000><B>Read this :</B></FONT></P>
<P dirltr>We recently have created a new agent , prepared for such activities 
and for contingencies , that is unknown specially to the unauthorized 
person&nbsp; who logged into your account without your permission .And for your 
safety , your account now is suspended , that is , you can receive transfers and 
can NOT make transfers&nbsp; ,&nbsp; you get a confirmation message when doing 
that , however , your transfers will NOT reach the recipient . Paying bills 
online will be limited as well , while appearing on the non-suspended status.

<P dirltr>&nbsp;</P>
<P dirltr>&nbsp;</P>
<P dirltr>----------------------------------------------------------</P>
<P dirltr>Q : How my account was accessed without my permission ?</P>
<P dirltr>A : Many reasons are available : 1st , some internet sites offer 
illegal contents to attract visitors&nbsp;. And without their permission 
,&nbsp;they place trojans ( a small &nbsp;high-risk program to open ports in 
your PC ) and they can&nbsp;spy on you&nbsp;by that small program to know your 
passwords&nbsp; . 2nd , you may accept files from an unknown person that have 
the same mission . 3rd , you may have accessed your online account via a public 
PC .</P>

However, if you encounter difficulties, there are hotlines at the Henri Barbusse gymnasium, every evening from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. to help you if necessary, to register online.

Dear,

Please remember to drop your regalia back to the regalia room at Claudelands.

Tuesday February 2 and Wednesday February 3 will be the elections for student representatives at the University of Burgundy. ARTenko is committed, and chooses to support Independent Associations!

Company: Company

A&I students come from student associations, which makes it possible to better target the issues of each course. They are independent because some elected officials do not come from student associations but above all they do not follow a political, union or religious ideology! The network of Associatives & Independents and the lists presented to the Central Councils of the uB best represent all sectors. Art history and archeology too!

"Hello Professor Manley,

 

I hope you are doing well. My name is  and I am an EC member of one of the four business professional fraternities at Drake. I am writing to you today to ask if you would be willing to spare a few minutes at the beginning of your classes at 9:30am and 11am tomorrow to allow a representative from my fraternity to come and speak to your students about our upcoming recruitment. There are four professional fraternities, two of which are open to all majors. Each fraternity works to focus on providing students with professional resources to enhance their skills and prepare them for their careers.

 

Our Meet and Greet event is Monday, February 7th, from 7:00-9:30 pm in Upper Olmstead. The dress code is business casual, however, if students are not able to come in business casual, it does not provide an issue.





If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me and I would be happy to talk more with you!

 

Thanks,

Attendance Policy:

Excuses for absences from mandatory chapter events must be submitted through the excuse portal before the beginning of an event to be considered. All absences approved as excused will not count against a member towards suspension.  Any unexcused absences will remain on a member's record until the time they make up the absence by coming to an EC meeting.


There are four events that are not excusable: Interviews, Midcourt, Court of Honor, and Initiation. If a member cannot make it to one of these events, the excuse cannot be made up at an EC meeting. However, if a member can come to part of the event, the partial absence may be made up by attending an EC meeting.

Once a member reaches three unexcused absences, the chapter will vote on whether or not to temporarily suspend the member in question. Reinstatement terms may rise with more unexcused absences.

"Happy Sunday everyone!

Wanted to take a moment to outline how things are going to look the next couple weeks 
while the semester gets underway with online classes. This info will be cross-posted in 
email & in Teams.

In the hope of reducing the risk of spreading the omicron variant through support center 
staff, we are reducing the number of people who will be working in person in Carnegie. 
As such:
1.	I will be working remotely for several weeks (end date not yet determined).
2.	There will be two ITCR leaders in Carnegie each day, rotating between Jerome, 
Clayton, and Greg.
3.	There will be two campus techs on duty in Carnegie each day on a rotating 
schedule; all others will be working remotely.
4.	We’ll have one imaging student working at a time in room 7.
5.	For all other student techs, we’ll have one working at the front desk in Carn; other 
students scheduled will be working either remotely or at the not-lead desk in the 
big room.
a.	The remote student should use the student2 account.
b.	The front desk phones should be logged into student5 & student6 – I 
expect student6 should be set to “do not disturb” most of the time.
c.	The classroom emergency phone should be logged into student4.
d.	The not-lead desk student/second remote student should use the student3 
account.
6.	Masks must be propertly worn at all times in Carnegie. You may only remove 
it to drink a beverage or eat something; you must be seated/stationary when 
doing so. (In other words, no walking around drinking from your water bottle.) 
Your mask must cover from above your nose to below your chin.
a.	I strongly recommend you wear an N95/KN95 mask or similar, until we’re 
past the omicron peak. If you need one, let me know. They can be safely 
reused by following some simple steps.
7.	There will be an all staff meeting scheduled in the very near future – please stay 
tuned for that info.
8.	From a support perspective, students may still walk-in to request assistance in 
the support center.
9.	Faculty/staff must have an appointment; these appointments are generated by 
campus techs after attempting remote support first. In other words: a faculty/staff 
member should not ask you to set an appointment on behalf of a campus tech. 
Make sure there’s a ticket entered and advise the user that the tech will set up 
the time with them.
10.	If you are feeling unwell for any reason, do not come to work. We don’t want 
germs spreading around, and this is NOT a case of “sharing is caring.” ??
a.	If you test positive at any time, please notify me ASAP in addition to 
notifying contacttracing@drake.edu.
11.	Remember to always include Allison and Sam in any communications where 
you’d normally contact me, especially in regard to scheduling related requests.

There’s a lot that’s changed lately, so I expect there will be a lot of confusion from our 
returning users. Here’s a short list:
1.	Microsoft MFA went live at the beginning of the month, replacing Duo.
2.	We have new/different tools for managing MFA settings for users that are part of 
Password Manager.
3.	myDrake and other services now require the use of MFA.
4.	MyDUSIS no longer exists and has been replaced by a tool called Self Service.
5.	A number of changes have been made to TeamDynamix services as they relate 
to Banner, myDrake, Self Service, etc – make sure you review the portal to 
familiarize yourself.
6.	Parent access to student information is changing, and ITS will NOT be able to fix 
their login issues; they will have to contact their student to fix access.

That’s the “quick” overview. Yes, I know it’s a lot. And yes, that means there’s more we 
haven’t yet covered.

As always, if you have questions, just ask! I’m available on Teams to chat anytime you 
need it.

"Hi all, 

If you are receiving this email, then you have expressed interest in the J22 travel seminar to South Africa 
(and Zimbabwe). 

I am Prof. Knepper, one of the professors for the class. The other professor, Herbert Moyo, is a 
Zimbabwean who teaches in South Africa. He will be with us for the entire trip and will also accompany 
us back to Drake, where he will serve as the S22 “Global Scholar in Residence.” 

The travel seminar will visit the cities of Johannesburg, Durban, and Pietermaritzburg in South Africa, as 
well as Bulawayo in Zimbabwe. (We will also spend much time in the countryside.) The focus of the trip 
is lived religion, which includes African Christianity, European/missionary Christianity, indigenous 
religion (especially sangoma practice), Islam, and Hinduism. We will visit many different places of 
worship. We will also spend some time working with students from University of KwaZulu-Natal (where 
Herbert teaches) on a photo-narrative project about lived religion. 

On Tuesday of next week (3/30), I will hold an informational session from 4-5 pm. Feel free to drop in 
any time to ask questions. Here is the link: https://drake-edu.zoom.us/j/82477311829.

Also, you may of course simply email questions to me. 

All best,

"Greetings Members of the Drake Community,

Today marks the start of Black History Month. We center and celebrate the empowerment, 
achievement, and contributions of African American communities, not only as they manifest in the 
present and come to us through the past—but in terms of the hope they hold for our collective future. 

History matters. 

The origins of Black History month go back to the leadership of intellectual giant, Dr. Carter G. Woodson. 
Woodson established the Association for the Study of African American Life and History (ASALH) in 1915 
after participating in a national event to commemorate the 50th anniversary of emancipation. Dr. 
Woodson worked tirelessly throughout his life to promote widespread knowledge of Black history. He 
knew the past and future are connected, declaring the vision this way, “We are going back to that 
beautiful history and it is going to inspire us to greater achievements.”

In February 1926, Woodson’s ASALH sponsored the first week-long celebration of Black history. This was 
timing they chose, in part, because the great Frederick Douglass was born on February 12. Within 20 
years, Black communities all over the country turned a week into a month and then, in 1976, the first 
official presidential declaration of February as Black History Month was conferred. This declaration has 
been made every year since. 

It’s vital we all continue to learn about, lift up, and honor the endless contributions of African Americans 
to every aspect of U.S.-American life. Black history is U.S.-American history. 

It’s also important we insist on our rights and responsibilities to do just that! As political pressures are 
mounting all over the country—including in the state of Iowa—to limit how fully and honestly we talk 
about U.S. racial history in public life, we need to deepen our knowledge of African American life, joy, 
wisdom, sacrifice and struggle to be honored as full citizens and human beings.  We need to understand 
the ways history continues to resonate in the present. Just today a dozen Historically Black Colleges and 
University’s (HBCUs) received bomb threads. Black lives and well-being matter. 

It's also a joy to celebrate Black History and recognize the many African American people who are the 
Drake community, who make Des Moines what it is, who are Iowa. Black creativity, brilliance, and 
commitment are boundless. 

I want to encourage you to participate in the countless opportunities for celebration and 
acknowledgement that will be offered to all of us this month. 

Read about members of the Drake community in a story series called Voices of Drake. The first story in 
the series highlights Jazlin Coley–Smith, Director for Equity and Inclusion. Show up to one of the many 
events sponsored by the Coalition of Black Students. Learn about the Black suffragette’s courage to 
secure the vote. Spend an evening with Ty Marcellus (NuWorld Comics) who is creating a universe to 
rival Marvel’s. Join Dr. Brandi Brimmer to hear about southern Black women’s journey to secure 
freedom for themselves after the Civil War and what these legacies mean for us today. 

There is so much to learn, celebrate, and continue to share.

Finally, in appreciation of Black History month, an offering of poetry, shared by Provost Sue Mattison. 
This poem was written by Clint Smith who is an award-winning poet, writer for the Atlantic and author 
of New York Times bestseller How the Word Is Passed. 

Meteor Shower
by Clint Smith

I read somewhere that meteor showers
are almost always named after

the constellations from which
they originate. It’s funny, I think,

how even the universe is telling us
that we can never get too far

from the place that created us.
How there is always a streak of our past

trailing closely behind us
like a smattering of obstinate memories.

Even when we enter a new atmosphere,
become subsumed in flames, turn to dust,

lose ourselves in the wind, and scatter
the surface of all that rests beneath us,

we bring a part of where we are from 
to every place we go.

appropriate. Please read the entirety of each message.

September 17, 2021

Key Points (as of this morning)
*	There are five students with confirmed cases of COVID-19 in on-campus isolation
*	There are 15 students with confirmed cases of COVID-19 off campus
*	There are 15 students in quarantine
*	79.8% of employees are fully vaccinated
*	70% of all registered students, 76% of students with at least one class in person, and 
86% of residential students have submitted their vaccination record
*	Securely report your vaccination to Drake
Upcoming OSHA COVID-19 Mitigation Requirements 
The Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is developing 
a rule that will require all employers with 100 or more employees to ensure their workforce is 
fully vaccinated or require any workers who remain unvaccinated to produce a negative test 
result on at least a weekly basis. OSHA will issue an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) to 
implement this requirement in the coming weeks. Once that ETS is issued, more will be known 
about the timeline for implementation and the specific requirements of the standard. 

Faculty, staff, and student employees who have not yet been vaccinated or submitted proof of 
vaccination are strongly encouraged to do so now so that the University is well positioned to 
comply with this new requirement once it takes effect. Any changes to Drake policies or 
protocols will be communicated to campus in a variety of ways, including through COVID-19 
Updates. Faculty, staff, and student employees should submit documentation using this secure, 
mobile friendly, and easy to use form. 

Drake Testing Options 
Students experiencing COVID-19 symptoms can be tested at no cost at the Student Health 
Center. Students should call 515-271-3731 before showing up in person. 

Drake administers PCR tests, which are the most accurate type of COVID-19 test. Due to the 
higher risk of producing a false negative result with an antigen test, the University strongly 
recommends obtaining a PCR test from the Student Health Center or seeking out a test site that 
administers PCR tests.

Faculty and staff experiencing COVID-19 symptoms must contact Chris Nickell, director of 
environmental health and safety, at chris.nickell@drake.edu to receive instructions on how to 
obtain a test at no charge from the University.

For more information about COVID-19 testing at Drake, please see the COVID-19 Testing FAQ.

Fall Break Status 
At this time, Fall Break remains scheduled for October 18 and 19. Given the rapidly changing 
impacts of the Delta COVID-19 variant on our community, Provost Mattison may move Fall 
Break to November 22 and 23 (Thanksgiving week) at her discretion, with Faculty Senate having 
consented to this potential change (Motion 22-01, August 5, 2021).

Student Vaccine Incentives Update 
Should Drake reach 80% of students with at least one class on campus reporting full vaccination 
by Sept. 24, 20 students will be awarded one-time (non-renewable) scholarships in the amount 
of $2,500. Currently 76% of students with at least one class on campus have submitted proof of 
vaccination to the University. Additional details can be found in this Aug. 6 message. 

Securely Report Your Vaccine
Submitting proof of your vaccination is highly encouraged so the University can make 
accurate and informed decisions about safe campus operations. Students, faculty, and staff 
should submit documentation using this secure, mobile friendly, and easy to use form. 

Face Coverings 
The University Face Coverings Policy remains in effect. Even if you believe everyone is 
vaccinated, this policy applies and will be enforced. It is important that we all consistently 
adhere to this policy to ensure we are protecting both ourselves and others within the campus 
community.

COVID-19 Symptoms
Please re-familiarize yourself with the CDC’s list of common COVID-19 symptoms. It is possible 
for fully vaccinated individuals to contract and spread COVID-19, so please be aware of changes 
in your health no matter your vaccination status.

Do Your Part 
It is up to each one of us to protect ourselves and each other. Employees and students living off 
campus who do not feel well must avoid coming to campus until they are healthy. Please 
continue to follow the University’s safety protocols: wear a mask and remember to wash your 
hands properly and often. By doing your best to avoid exposure to the coronavirus, you are 
helping save lives and medical resources for those who need them most. 

Minimizing the risk of COVID-19 infections is a shared responsibility. Drake’s plans are aligned 
and consistent with local and state guidance. The University follows recommendations from the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Iowa Department of Public Health, and Polk 
County health officials.

Subject: Opportunity to participate in research at the Dep. of Math and CS. September 10 at 2pm 
 
Hello everyone, 

I hope you had a great start to your new academic year! I want to provide some information on 
an excellent opportunity to participate in some fantastic research this semester. Our 
Mathematics and Computer Science Department will hold our annual information meeting on 
September 10th at C-S 301. Everyone is welcome to stop by to meet with professors and hear 
about what great research topics you and your classmates can explore this semester. At the 
meeting, each professor will talk a bit about their projects, they will be available to answer any 
questions you might have about their projects, and you will be able to sign up to participate. No 
prior experience or specific classes are required for most projects, so it's a great opportunity to 
find new (or join your old ;) ) like-minded friends and make your resumes stronger and more 
distinct. This year, we have various projects; here are a few: Human-Centered AI and ML, 
analyzing the Iowa Youth Survey, Image Parsing for Robotic Applications, Data Science for 
Economics, Iowa State-wide Mathematics Transition Research in math education, Hopping 
Forcing on Graphs, etc.

Learn more about research at our department on September 10th at 2 pm!

"Hello GK Residents,
 
Happy end of the semester! Thanks for all of your help in making this a great year in Goodwin Kirk! 
 
As we wind down, I wanted to send out a quick note regarding some recent vandalism on whiteboards. I 
have received some reports recently of individuals having their dry erase boards altered and wanted to 
address the building. 
 
As a reminder, it is a violation of the Residence Hall Handbook to deface the whiteboards in the 
residence halls. We are watching for those who are violating these policies and will be acting 
appropriately following the Student Code of Conduct. 
 
Please do not write on a board that is not yours, run fingers and hands through messages or drawings, 
or erase boards that are not your own. We appreciate everyone working together to make sure 
individuals and our community spaces are respected.  
 
Feel free to reach out if you have any information, questions or concerns.
 
Good Luck on your final exams and have a great summer!
 
Sincerely,

"Hi,

You’ll be presenting to the class, the VPs at Wellmark, and the collection of mentors. No formal dress 
code, but dressing up is probably a good idea.

The general expectation is that you’ll fill about 3 minutes with a presentation of your project. Assume 
the audience isn’t familiar with your topic. Describe what you did (or what you discovered). There will 
likely be a few minutes for Q&A afterwards.

Does this help?

"Dear

At Drake University we want our students to have the best educational experience possible, and the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) helps by providing vital information about activities in and out of the classroom. For example, we have used previous results to help shape our efforts to deliver high-impact learning experiences such as service-learning, internships, research, and study abroad. Your participation is critical, so I hope you will complete NSSE—an opportunity only available to first-year and senior students.

In appreciation for participating, we will enter all students who complete the survey by April 20th into a drawing for 1 of 15 bookstore gift cards worth $50 each. Your chances of winning depend on how many complete the survey; the last time we administered this survey about 428 students responded.

"Hello     

I hope all is going well with you, I am just messaging you as you once applied or took part in our projects, so I thought you might be interested in our new upcoming opportunities, especially a funded trip to Colombia next month.

First off, thanks again for being involved with Gotoco! I write to you from Thailand, where we have just arrived with our first cohort of Trinity CertTESOL trainees—our first group since the pandemic began! We are planning exciting things here for the summer and have a host of other great global initiatives opening elsewhere too. 

There have been quite a few developments with our organisation and project in recent months. We are delighted to now be offering destinations across Europe for the summer (Italy, Spain, Germany, Poland, and more). We also do off-cycle and longer term opportunities in Thailand/Colombia.

Generally, over recent years, we have sought to offer opportunities in East Asia (primarily Mainland China, but also Hong Kong and Japan), but East Asian projects won't run this summer because severe COVID restrictions seem likely to remain in place and these make travel for programmes like ours very challenging. So, East Asian locations are waiting for a future time when COVID restrictions in East Asia relax.

Please read the two points below and be in touch if you'd like to be involved.

1. Final openings for mid-April funded trip to Colombia:

I am just messaging now because we still have a few openings in next month's fully funded Colombia opportunities. If you are at all interested please fill in this form and we can set up an interview. It is a fantastic programme, participants will be working with the YMCA charity in Bogoá, delivering English classes and getting Trinity CertTESOL trained (all funded and free). We have similar projects upcoming in May and June too. 

2. Summer programme list now published:

Our programme list is now published for all Gotoco'ers that have held a position with us for this summer. We have fantastic opportunities running this summer, across Europe (Italy, Spain, Poland, Germany, Switzerland..), Thailand, Palestine, & Colombia. At this link you can read up on all of them and advise us which ones you'd like to do.

If you wish, you can join us in Colombia from April and also summer somewhere else, so please take a look at the above opportunities to see if you are interested. 

A reminder on eligibility: these programmes are supported by the UK government, and are open for all UK and Republic of Ireland residents/citizens (including anyone on long-stay visas, such as student visas in these countries). On the programmes, you will teach English while working towards a funded TEFL certificate, your return flights, meals and accommodation are all funded. For those that aren't eligible through a link to the UK or Ireland, we are offering similar summer opportunities in the UK, so please join us in the UK this summer (check out the link above and advise us there if you are interested).

Thanks for reading this far. Looking forward to chatting soon!

Best wishes,

Danny

"Good Afternoon,

I hope you have a safe and fun St. Patties Day! I’m reaching out to see what your plans are for after graduation. Have your original plans changed? I wanted to provide an opportunity that you may not know about, pathway to becoming a leader of Marines!  As a college graduate, you can use your degree to become an officer in the United States Marine Corps.  Officers are leaders that use their education and experiences to train, develop, coach and mentor young Marines.


Do you like physical fitness, complex problem-solving, leadership, and decision making?


Do you seek to serve a purpose greater than yourself?

What do you know about Marine Corps Officer Commissioning Programs?

Marine Corps Officers are four-year college graduates who serve in leadership roles and can specialize in nearly any occupation available outside of the Marine Corps.  Officers are employed in management roles, typically providing guidance and oversight to enlisted Marines.

Officers have higher levels of responsibility than enlisted members, and also receive higher pay.  Starting salaries for full-time officers are typically around $55,000-$70,000 with increases tied to promotions.  This pay includes full medical, dental, life insurance. You getting a living allowance as well, which is based on your rank and zip code and is nontaxable. Expect to make near six figures by your fourth year.

Officer Candidates School is one of the premier leadership training courses offered in the world today.  Marine Corps Officer training has given students just like you the leadership skills and experience to go on to successful careers both in the Marine Corps and Corporate America.  If you are mentally, physically, and academically qualified you can apply for Aviation, Ground, or Law programs.  The Marine Corps has over 22 different career specialties to include everything from Public Affairs, Infantry, Intelligence and Logistics and more.

Do you want to find out more?  Call, text, or email me.  Go to the website to watch testimonials and videos from candidates and officers.  You can learn a lot from the website: www.marines.com/officer.

"Dear,

Our records indicate that you have either started or completed the Fall 2021 Commuter Application.

If you no longer wish to have a commuter meal plan for the spring semester, you do not need to do anything.

If you are an approved commuter student and wish to have a Spring 2022 meal plan you will need to complete the Spring 2022 Commuter Application and select a meal plan for the Spring Term. 

If you are an athlete that has a meal plan scholarship. Please note that the 125B meal plan is covered under that scholarship. If you select a meal plan other than the 125B you will be responsible for paying the difference.

Please log into MyDrake, click on the fork&knife icon, click on Apply Here, to complete the Spring 2022 Commuter Application and to request a Spring meal plan, if desired.
